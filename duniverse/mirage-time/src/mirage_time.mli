(** {1 Time device}

    This module defines a target-agnostic MirageOS sleep operation.  *)

val sleep_ns: int64 -> unit Lwt.t
(** [sleep_ns n] blocks the current task for [n] nanoseconds, treating [n] as
    unsigned.  *)

(** {1 Values used by the schedulers} *)

type sleep = { time : int64; mutable canceled : bool; thread : unit Lwt.u }
(** The type for a sleeping task. *)

val new_sleepers : unit -> sleep list
(** [new_sleepers ()] is used by the scheduler to find at their convenience
    the tasks that need to be enqueued into their task set. This also empties
    the list of sleepers. *)
